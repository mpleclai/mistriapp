# Mistriapp

 - Mostly just a sample project for me testing out Android architecture and tools with the end goal of maybe being a functional App resource for playing Fields of Mistria
 - currently looking into best utilizing a build-logic folder to improve gradle usage in the project and exploring dagger/hilt for dependency injection
